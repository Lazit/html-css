<!--

header is different with head // header can replaced with div
<div id="header"></div>
<div id="main"></div>
footer is 꼬릿말
div is non-meaning tags
header,main,footer...etc is semantic tags which it makes you can easily understand what it is 
span is for short text. It's meaningless by itself
these things are called "content sectioning"
